#Background
	Since the early days of computing, chess algorithms and AI have pushed the limits of machine learning and computer science forward while enabling amateurs and professionals to play and practice against digital opponents. These days, friends and rivals can challenge each other virtually over the internet using sites like chess.com. However, an essential element of gameplay, the physicality of a chessboard and tactility of each piece is lost when engaging in these solutions. For this project, we propose to create a convolutional neural network to detect the state of a real chessboard using a single camera. The model we train could be used to seamlessly bridge the gameplay of two players using physical pieces in their homes.
	Two computer vision steps are included in detecting the state of a chessboard. The first is to locate the chessboard. To accomplish this, we intend to use the built-in chessboard detection in OpenCV or perform an edge/feature detection algorithm of our own. The second step is classifying and locating the chess pieces. For this task, we plan on training a convolutional neural network built using pytoch and vgg with a pre-existing, public domain dataset of 693 pre-segmented and labeled images depicting white and black pieces on a green and white board.
