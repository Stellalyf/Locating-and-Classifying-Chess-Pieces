# Locating-and-Classifying-Chess-Pieces
For the final project of cse455, our team is composed of Colin Acton, Bob Xiaohai Hu, Yifan Liu.

## To run our code
+ **Trainning:** Based on google colab, Model_train.ipnb is for training our model, and calculate the accuracy for model performed on testing dataset. you can modify the neural net work type by substitute the 'faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml' in the configuration cell.
 check [dectorn2 offical github page to choose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/configs/COCO-Detection) what model we can choose.
